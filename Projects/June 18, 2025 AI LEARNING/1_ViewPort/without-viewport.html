      <p>This page DOES NOT include the viewport meta tag.</p>
      <p>
        Look at how tiny everything is on a simulated mobile device! The browser
        has rendered our 350px card inside a fake ~980px viewport and then
        zoomed everything out to fit the small screen. This is unreadable and
        unusable.
